Editor Corner
=============

As an editor, you can set an animation for your content elements by going to the **Animation** tab.

The screenshot below shows how you can set up an animation. You have the option to individually adjust the animation speed and delay of the content element.

.. tip::

   Please check your animation in the frontend to ensure a pleasant appearance for your users when they scroll through your page!

   Elements animating in different directions can be very distracting.

.. note::

   The animations are implemented with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), which provides smooth animations and better performance. The animations are triggered when scrolling both down and up.
