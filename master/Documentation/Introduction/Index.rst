What Does This Extension Do?
================

This extension allows you to set up frontend animations for your content elements that are triggered when the elements are scrolled into the browser's viewport.

The animations are based on the powerful GSAP library (GreenSock Animation Platform) with the ScrollTrigger plugin, which provides smooth, high-performance animations that work when scrolling both down and up.
